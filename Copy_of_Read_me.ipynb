        "Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has\n",
        "been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this\n",
        "fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company\n",
        "and whether any predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset\n",
        "has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing,\n",
        "starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is\n",

        "### Step 3: Regression Model Building\n",
        "Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Implement Multiple Linear Regression ,Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic net Regression, knn regressor and Random forest regressor models to predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock. Tune the models by adjusting the hyperparameters to optimize performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Model Evaluation\n",
        "Evaluate the models' performance using root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. Compare the performance of the models to determine which one performs better.\n",

        "\n",
